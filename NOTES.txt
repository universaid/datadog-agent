This should be an inspectably impact-free change, at the cost of readability;
that is, a reviewer should be able to tell easiliy from each commit that, when
cca_in_ad is false, the behavior does not change.

When the cca_in_ad setting is true:

* AD sends CCA configs for containers without other LogsConfig
    * [DONE] AD no longer sends service configs (FIXME's)
    * [WIP] AD sends CCA configs -- need to figure out what these look like

* Logs-Agent doesn't handle servies anymore
    * [DONE] AD logs scheduler does not send services
    * [DONE] CCA scheduler disabled
    * [DONE] k8s launcher disabled
    * [DONE] Docker launcher only pairs sources with services if feature flag is false

* Logs-Agent handles CCA configs
    * always handled by the docker launcher (?)
    * set source, service correctly
        * [WIP] let's put this byzantine logic in a new module
    * Docker launcher recognizes kcur, dcur, force_dcur, path accessibility,
      LogWhat, and registry in deciding whether to log a container from socket or file
        * [WIP] let's put this byzantine logic in a new module
